# awscloudformation-newbie

This project is for self learning. I have created basic cloudformation templates from Scratch.

Templates:
1. basic.yml : Template is used to create S3 bucket with desired parameters
2. basic_lambda_code_zip.yml : Template is used to create Lambda function with code as Zip. I have added tags under the Properties section with the name Tags. 
3. basic_lambda_dockerimage.yml : Template is used to create Lambda function with docker image. 
4. master_lambda_s3.yml : Template used to create stack of s3 and lambda.

To be continued.......
